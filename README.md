# 🎧 Spotify UI Clone (HTML & CSS Only)

A beginner-level static clone of Spotify’s homepage built using pure HTML and CSS.
This project was developed as a learning exercise to understand front-end layout techniques and UI structuring.
It helped me practice designing real-world interfaces and improve my CSS styling skills.
